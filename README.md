[http://127.0.0.1:5500/tink-her-hack-temp/index.html]

### Project Description
[Web-based automation system that monitors temperature, humidity, and motion of people to intelligently control electrical appliances. The system automatically activates cooling and lighting devices based on environmental conditions and sends alerts to email if appliances are left running without occupancy]

### The Problem statement
[The Problem statement
Electricity is wasted in homes, classrooms, and offices
In Government Offices: Lights & fans run in empty rooms
RECENTLY AN INCIDENT HAPPENED AT SECRETARIAT: Pedestal fan overheated and exploded.
No real-time monitoring
High electricity bills
No energy usage analytics]

### The Solution
[The Solution
Real-time climate monitoring
Occupancy-based automation
If motion not detected and the appliances are still running,email alerts are sent.
Energy analytics dashboard
Solution prepared by combining United Nations SDG 7 - Affordable & Clean Energy
United Nations SDG 13 - Climate Action]

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
